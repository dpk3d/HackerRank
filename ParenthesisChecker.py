Given an expression string x. Examine whether the pairs and the orders of {,},(,),[,] are correct in exp.
For example, the function should return 'true' for exp = [()]{}{[()()]()} and 'false' for exp = [(]).

Note: The drive code prints "balanced" if function return true, otherwise it prints "not balanced".

Example 1:

Input:
{([])}
Output: 
true
Explanation: 
{ ( [ ] ) }. Same colored brackets can form 
balanced pairs, with 0 number of 
unbalanced bracket.

Example 2:

Input: 
()
Output: 
true
Explanation: 
(). Same bracket can form balanced pairs, 
and here only 1 type of bracket is 
present and in balanced way.

Example 3:

Input: 
([]
Output: 
false
Explanation: 
([]. Here square bracket is balanced but 
the small bracket is not balanced and 
Hence , the output will be unbalanced.

 #  If the character is a closing parentheses, pop the top element from the stack and 
 # check whether it matches the corresponding opening parentheses for the current closing parentheses.
 #  If the stack is empty and all parentheses have been matched, return True. Otherwise, return False.
